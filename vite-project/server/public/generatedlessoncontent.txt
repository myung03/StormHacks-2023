## Introduction to Merging Datasets

In this lesson, we will cover the topic of merging datasets in R, which is a process of combining two or more datasets into a single dataset based on a common variable(s). Merging datasets is a common task in data analysis as it allows us to combine information from multiple sources into a single dataset that can be used for further analysis. In this lesson, we will cover two kinds of methods to merge datasets: **inner_join()** and **left_join()**.

<?!>## Inner Join

The inner_join() function is used to merge two datasets based on matching values in a particular attribute(s). When merging two datasets, the variable names of the attribute(s) in both datasets should be the same to use the default syntax. It is also recommended that the variable type of the key variable(s) in both datasets also be the same.

To perform an inner join in R, follow these steps:

1. Load the two datasets that you want to merge into R.
2. Identify the common variable(s) in both datasets that will be used to merge them.
3. Use the inner_join() function to merge the datasets based on the common variable(s).
4. Save the merged dataset as a new dataset.

<?!>## Left Join

The left_join() function is used to merge two datasets and returns all rows from the left dataset, and all columns from both datasets. This means that the left dataset is kept intact, and new information is added from the right dataset for the matching observations.

To perform a left join in R, follow these steps:

1. Load the two datasets that you want to merge into R.
2. Identify the common variable(s) in both datasets that will be used to merge them.
3. Use the left_join() function to merge the datasets based on the common variable(s).
4. Save the merged dataset as a new dataset.

<?!>## Non-One-to-One Matching

In some situations, the attribute(s) used to merge two datasets do not have to be key variables for both datasets. An observation in one dataset can match with multiple observations in the other dataset through non-one-to-one matching. However, the variable or variable(s) to perform the merge should uniquely identify at least one of the datasets.

To perform a non-one-to-one matching in R, follow these steps:

1. Load the two datasets that you want to merge into R.
2. Identify the common variable(s) in both datasets that will be used to merge them.
3. Use the left_join() function to merge the datasets based on the common variable(s).
4. Save the merged dataset as a new dataset.

<?!>## Conclusion

Merging datasets in R is a useful tool in data analysis that allows us to combine information from multiple sources into a single dataset. The inner_join() and left_join() functions are the two most commonly used methods for merging datasets in R. By following the steps outlined in this lesson, you should be able to merge datasets in R with ease.
