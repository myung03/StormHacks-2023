## Introduction

In this lecture, we will cover the topic of merging datasets in R. Merging datasets is a common task in data analysis, as it allows us to combine data from different sources to gain a more complete picture of our data. There are two main methods for merging datasets in R - inner_join() and left_join(). In this lecture, we will focus on the left_join() function.

<?!>## Merging Datasets

When we merge two datasets, we match observations from both datasets based on matching values in a particular attribute(s). The left_join() function is used to bring as much information from one dataset to another while keeping all observations in the original dataset. 

<?!>## The left_join() Function

The left_join() function returns all rows from the first dataset and all columns from both datasets. To use the left_join() function, the variable names of the attribute(s) in both datasets should be the same. It is also recommended that the variable type of the key variable(s) in both datasets also be the same.

<?!>## Example: Merging Two Datasets

Suppose we have two datasets - example1 and example2. We want to improve the example1 dataset by bringing as much information from the example2 dataset as possible. To do this, we will use the left_join() function.

```R
merged2 <- left_join(example1, example2)
```

For matching values of the joining attribute – in this case, the combination of gvkey and fyear, left_join() links the information appearing in both datasets. Those observations in the “left” dataset which do not have matching observations in the other dataset will be retained in the resultant merged dataset, while those observations in the “right” dataset which do not have matching observations in the other dataset will not be retained in the resultant dataset.

<?!>## Non-One-to-One Matching

When we merge two datasets whose key variable(s) uniquely identify each observation within the dataset, this kind of merge is called a one-to-one merge. However, when the attribute(s) used as a basis of matching the observations in two datasets do not have to be key variables for both datasets, an observation in one dataset can match with multiple observations in the other datasets through non-one-to-one matching. 

<?!>## Example: Non-One-to-One Matching

Suppose we have two datasets - example3 and NAICS_2_6_digit_codes. We want to merge the two datasets so that each observation will have the following variables: gvkey, fyear, naicsh, and NAICS_description. This will attempt to add the industry description to every observation in the Example3 dataset.

```R
merged3 <- left_join(example3, NAICS_2_6_digit_codes, by = c("naicsh" = "NAICS"))
```

In this example, the left_join() function will link the information appearing in both datasets based on the matching values of the naicsh and NAICS variables. 

<?!>## Conclusion

Merging datasets is a powerful tool in data analysis. The left_join() function allows us to bring as much information from one dataset to another while keeping all observations in the original dataset. By following the formatting rules, we can easily merge datasets and gain a more complete picture of our data.
